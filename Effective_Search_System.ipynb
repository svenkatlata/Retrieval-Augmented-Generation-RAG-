      "Assistant:  The Goods and Services Tax (Compensation to States) Act, 2017, was enacted to support state revenues by providing them with compensation for any loss of revenue arising from the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST). Here’s how it works:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Objective**: The primary goal of the Act is to ensure that states are not financially disadvantaged by the shift to the GST system, which replaced various state and central taxes.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Compensation Mechanism**: The Act provides a framework for compensating states for any revenue shortfall. This is calculated based on the projected growth rate of state revenues, which was assumed to be 14% per annum from the base year 2015-16.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Cess Collection**: To fund this compensation, a GST compensation cess is levied on certain luxury and sin goods. The revenue collected from this cess is distributed to the states to cover their revenue losses.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Duration**: The compensation was initially intended to be provided for a period of five years from the date of implementation of GST, which began on July 1, 2017.\n",
      "\n",
      "This Act ensures that states can maintain their revenue levels during the transition to the GST regime, thereby supporting their financial stability and enabling them to continue funding public services effectively.\n"
